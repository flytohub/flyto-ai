# Architecture

Runtime flow:

```text
user/cloud/CLI
  -> Agent
  -> provider chat loop
  -> ToolRegistry
  -> flyto_ai.tools.core_tools
  -> flyto-core MCP handler
  -> structured result + evidence metadata
  -> blueprint/eval/trace feedback
```

Key boundaries:
- Providers never call `flyto-core` directly.
- Cloud imports `flyto-ai` contracts and dispatchers, not `flyto-core` internals.
- Blueprint learning stores successful tool chains and redacted evidence, not
  secrets. Portable exchange is explicit; Flyto2 AI does not publish bundles by
  itself.
- Model-facing Blueprint outcome calls are community observations. Only the
  deterministic closed-loop executor can attach the in-process capability that
  records `local_verified` evidence.
- Blueprint signing keys and trusted publisher mappings stay host-controlled
  and are never exposed through model tool schemas.
- MCP metadata is additive: existing tool names, schemas, and result shapes stay compatible.

Runtime packages:
- `assistant` and `intelligence` perform deterministic pre-routing, recovery, selector resolution, and interaction control before provider fallback.
- `providers` normalize model chat, streaming, tool calls, usage, failover, and cost records.
- `tools` owns definitions and handlers; Core registry definitions are discovered lazily instead of copied.
- `memory`, `evolution`, `cache`, `session`, and `transcript` retain bounded learning and evidence state.
- `permissions`, `prompt`, `redaction`, `vault`, `sandbox`, and `agents` enforce execution and data boundaries.
- `channels`, `telegram`, `scheduler`, and `extensions` adapt external events without bypassing the agent/tool contract.

Interface surfaces:
- Python consumers import the package facade documented in `docs/API.md`.
- CLI and HTTP/SSE clients use contracts documented in `docs/CLI_AND_MCP.md`.
- MCP hosts negotiate JSON-RPC protocol versions and discover tools at runtime.
- Generated symbol and operator references under `docs/reference/` remain source-derived and are checked in CI.

Core contract:
- `get_core_capability_manifest` reports contract version, installed core version, tool fingerprint, recipes support, module categories, and per-tool risk metadata.
- `execute_module` validates params before execution when `flyto-core` exposes `validate_params`.
- Tool logs include `mcp.source`, `mcp.contract_version`, and module or recipe identity.

## Adaptive security campaign boundary

```text
LLM planner
  -> typed campaign + proposed PlanIR steps
  -> scope / authorization / allowlist / budget gate
  -> existing closed-loop MCP plan
  -> permission gate + flyto-core validation and execution
  -> assertions + compact proof evidence
  -> allowlisted, raw-content-free planner projection
  -> bounded re-plan or verified verdict
```

- The LLM is the decision and prioritization layer; it never becomes execution
  authority. Every round enters through the existing four-tool MCP contract.
- The campaign contract is part of plan identity. Changing target scope,
  authorization, mode, module allowlist, budget, or prior usage changes the
  stored plan hash.
- Active probes, exploit validation, and credential validation require
  progressively stronger authorization. Active steps also require an explicit
  in-scope target and a proof assertion.
- Authorization expiry, scope, module allowlist, request budget, and cost
  budget are checked again at dispatch time, including repaired steps.
- Evidence returned to a subsequent model round is an allowlisted projection
  containing facts and fingerprints, never raw bodies, HTML, headers, cookies,
  credentials, prompts, or attacker-controlled error text.
- A successful Core call alone is not a security verdict. Verification requires
  the runtime closed loop, assertions, budgets, and one proof record per
  executed request; otherwise the verdict is `not_proved`.

## Robotics planning boundary

```text
Flyto Robotics routed request
  -> validate request size, shortlist, capabilities, locations, routes
  -> compile provider-native JSON Schema
  -> structured model completion
  -> independent plan/safety/route validation
  -> optional single bounded repair
  -> plan + tamper-evident planning attestation
  -> Flyto Robotics final validation and execution
```

- `robotics_planning.py` owns the provider-neutral request, response, and
  attestation boundary. It does not import Flyto Robotics source.
- The routed capability shortlist is the authority ceiling. Model output cannot
  introduce a capability or argument field outside that contract.
- Complete route candidates become exact JSON Schema `prefixItems` variants.
  Model choice remains real, while waypoint omission and cross-route splicing
  become structurally invalid.
- Provider validation is not execution authorization. Flyto Robotics verifies
  the hashes, route, policy, and executable plan again before movement.
- `robotics_planner_server.py` is a loopback development adapter, not a public
  authenticated service. It suppresses prompt-bearing access logs and bounds
  request, response, timeout, and error detail sizes.
